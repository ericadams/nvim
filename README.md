# nvim
My nvim configuration. 

## Themes
This assumes you are using Neovim and iTerm2. You can grab the One Dark iTerm theme [here](https://github.com/anunez/one-dark-iterm).

You will need patched fonts for airline. You can install all patched fonts in [this repository](https://github.com/powerline/fonts), or just download and install the ones you want.

I use [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) Semi Bold at 14pt. 

Note: You will have to manually copy the onedark vim-airline-theme and rename it one.vim
```
cp $HOME/.config/nvim/colors/airline-one.vim $HOME/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-airline-themes/autoload/airline/themes/one.vim
```
