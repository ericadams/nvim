# nvim
My nvim configuration. This assumes you are using Neovim and iTerm2. You can grab the One Dark iTerm theme [here](https://github.com/anunez/one-dark-iterm).

Note: You will have to manually copy the onedark vim-airline-theme and rename it one.vim
```
cp $HOME/.config/nvim/colors/airline-one.vim $HOME/.config/nvim/plugged/vim-airline-themes/autoload/airline/themes/one.vim
```
